# hello-world
first project
Im Romina, 19 years old, student at sbcc.
I love to workout and I loved riding my motorcycle before it was totaled.
I will work hard to get to where I want to be , and I have learnt if you want something you dont give up no matter the struggles and stress that it comes with.
So I will become sucessful and a professional coder so I can make a change in the world.
I will also work hard to get back on my bike just have to find alternatives because the streets are not safe nor fun.
